# Python-Shiny-Homework

The zip contains 2 Python programs made by me for a homework.
I used Shiny.express library which helps me to make web-apps in Python, without using HTML/CSS.
In other words the library has front-end designing functionality, combined with actual back-end possibilities since I used decorator functions for that.
There is also database implementation with pandas library.
